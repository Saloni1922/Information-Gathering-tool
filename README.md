# Information Gathering tool (Footprinting)


It involves collecting as much publicly available information as possible about a target system, network, organization, or even an individual. This information is then used to identify potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

# Purpose

The purpose of footprinting is to build a comprehensive picture of the target's digital presence. This includes things like the target's IP address range, operating systems, network infrastructure.

# Methods


There are two main methods for footprinting
# passive 

Passive footprinting:- involves collecting information from publicly available sources without directly interacting with the target. 

# Active 

Active footprinting:- involves techniques that initiate communication with the target system, such as sending probes or packets.

# Always get permission before collecting any information that might be considered private.

# The information you gather through footprinting can be powerful. Use it responsibly and ethically.
